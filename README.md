# About this project
Flight booking application for CS202 project during the Winter 2018 term. This console-based program simulates booking a flight online (a la Expedia, Hipmunk etc). It uses multiple self-created data structures (binary trees, linked lists) to store flights and their data then prompts the user with multiple options like purchasing, searching, viewing itenerary and so forth.
